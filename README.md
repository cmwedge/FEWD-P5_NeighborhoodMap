Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 5: Neighborhood Map
==============================================================
##Overview
This application provides a map of an assortment of MLB stadiums. Stadiums can be
selected by clicking on their marker. This centers the map on the selected stadium
and loads summary Wikipedia information into an InfoWindow above the marker.

Stadiums can also be selected via a drop-down list in the navigation menu. Doing so
exhibits the same functionality as clicking a marker.

Finally, stadiums can be filtered in real-time via a textbox in the navigation
menu.
